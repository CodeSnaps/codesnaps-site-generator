It seems that centering a div horizontally and vertically is as old of a problem as the web itself.

There are many ways to do it, and with Tailwind CSS, it's very easy.

With Tailwind CSS, you'll never have to touch your CSS files unless you want to.

With a few helper classes, you can easily center your divs horizontally and vertically, and here are three ways to do it.

We'll go through each method and explain what each class does. If you just want to see the code, feel free to skip to the code section.

## Method #1: Flexbox

The first technique we will explore is the use of flexbox.

Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout module that provides a flexible way to allocate space between elements in a container.

### Just Tailwind CSS

Here's how to center a div using flexbox with Tailwind CSS:

```jsx title="Method #1: Flexbox"
<div class="flex min-h-screen justify-center items-center">I'm centered</div>
```

- <InlineCode code="flex" /> sets the display property to flex. This allows us to
  use flexbox.
- <InlineCode code="min-h-screen" /> sets the min-height property to 100vh. This
  ensures that the div takes up the full height of the screen. Without it, we would
  not be able to see the effect of centering the div vertically.
- <InlineCode code="justify-center" /> and <InlineCode code="items-center" /> actually
  center the div horizontally and vertically.

### Tailwind CSS Classes to Vanilla CSS

To get a better understanding, here's what the vanilla CSS of the Tailwind CSS classes would look like.

```css title="Tailwind CSS to Vanilla CSS"
.flex {
  display: flex;
}

.min-h-screen {
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.justify-center {
  justify-content: center;
}

.items-center {
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Vanilla HTML and CSS

And here's how you'd do this completely with vanilla HTML and CSS.

```html title="HTML"
<div class="container">
  <div>I'm centered</div>
</div>
```

```css title="CSS"
.container {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Method #2: Grid Layout

The second technique we will explore is the use of Grid.

Grid is another powerful CSS layout module that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts with ease.

With Tailwind CSS, centering a div using grid is easy.

### Just Tailwind CSS

```jsx title="Method #2: Grid"
<div class="grid place-items-center min-h-screen">I'm centered</div>
```

- <InlineCode code="grid" /> sets the display property to grid.
- <InlineCode code="place-items-center" /> sets the align-items and justify-items
  properties to center. This allows us to center the div both horizontally and vertically.
- <InlineCode code="min-h-screen" /> sets the min-height property to 100vh. Similar
  to the flexbox example, this ensures that the div takes up the full height of the
  screen.

### Tailwind CSS Classes to Vanilla CSS

To get a better understanding, here's what the vanilla CSS of the Tailwind CSS classes would look like.

```css title="Tailwind CSS to Vanilla CSS"
.grid {
  display: grid;
}

.place-items-center {
  place-items: center;
}

.min-h-screen {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Vanilla HTML and CSS

And here's how you'd do this completely with vanilla HTML and CSS.

```html title="HTML"
<div class="container">I'm centered</div>
```

```css title="CSS"
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

## Method #3: Absolute Positioning

The last technique uses absolute positioning. We position elements relative to their parent container or the document itself.

This method is not my go-to method, but it's still worth mentioning.

### Just Tailwind CSS

```jsx title="Method #3: Absolute Positioning"
<div class="min-h-screen">
  <div class="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2">
    I'm centered
  </div>
</div>
```

- <InlineCode code="absolute" /> sets the position property to absolute. This positioning
  makes the div independent of the document flow, so it can be placed precisely.
- <InlineCode code="min-h-screen" /> sets the min-height property to 100vh. This
  ensures that the div takes up the full height of the screen.
- <InlineCode code="top-1/2" /> and <InlineCode code="left-1/2" /> - These classes
  position the div at the center of its parent container.
- <InlineCode code="-translate-x-1/2" /> and <InlineCode code="-translate-y-1/2" /> shift
  the div back by half of its width and height, respectively, ensuring perfect centering.

### Tailwind CSS Classes to Vanilla CSS

To get a better understanding, here's what the vanilla CSS of the Tailwind CSS classes would look like.

```css title="Tailwind CSS to Vanilla CSS"
.min-h-screen {
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.absolute {
  position: absolute;
}

.top-1/2 {
  top: 50%;
}

.left-1/2 {
  left: 50%;
}

.-translate-x-1/2 {
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}

.-translate-y-1/2 {
  transform: translateY(-50%);
}
```

### Vanilla HTML and CSS

And here's how you'd do this completely with vanilla HTML and CSS.

```html title="HTML"
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="container">I'm centered</div>
</div>
```

```css title="CSS"
.wrapper {
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

## Conclusion
